## Preamble 

**COVID** has changed learning forever. There is a paradigm shift in the way people learnt pre and post COVID, there is high growth and adoption in Education Technology. We are experiencing an unplanned and rapid migration to online learning. A huge number of people started joining online courses to **reskill** and **upskill**.

It is clear that this pandemic has utterly disrupted the way we learn. It had both positive and negative impacts. There was a terrible disconnect between the enrollment rate and completion rate which questioned the impact of online learning.

## Problem Statement

Learner's drop out rate is up by **67 %** with most of them leaving due to a lack of Motivation and engaging content. We need to fix this problem by focusing on ways to **Motivate** the users ,Personalise and **Reward** their learning journey.

## Mission Statement 

To build an Platform (Bountyz) to reskill and upskill the learning community across the globe. Bountyz makes them more productive and efficient by providing personalized content, learning pathways with AI-driven recommendations (future roadmap) and by using LTEM (Learning-Transfer Evaluation / **Kirk Patricks Model**) to increase **ROI** on learners journey . Bountyz **Incentivizes** learners by streaming **rewards** when a certain **milestone** is achieved.

## Design Document

## Our solution
We created a dApp that can connect Sponsor and Learner together to achieve learning goals, that can create business impact for the organization. Sponsor can signup, onboard learners, create courses, assign reward for courses. Learner can learn the courses, take assessment and earn rewards in USDCx super token. Learner can unwrap the token to stable coin and withdraw to their exchange account.
